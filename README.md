Publication repository whose main goal is the keep all references used by KnEDLe Project members.

**Please check your BIB entries**. 

Entries generated automatically at **Google Scholar usually have mistakes**, such as:
* Bad entry type, e.g. a technical report is in the form of "@Article" instead of "@TechReport", papers in conferences included as "@Miscelaneous" instead of "@InProceedings", etc.
* Missing information, e.g. PhD thesis without school name, missing year, missing publisher, missing conference name, etc.
* Repeated information, e.g. publication year appears in the field year and also in the conference name. The publisher appears in the name of the conference and in the field publisher, etc.
* Several other mistakes. Again, please check your references instead of simply copying from Google.

Give as much information as possible. If possible, include the abstract.

Please follow a fixed standard for the search key. Teo's suggestion: 
A_B_C_D_E
where
* A: last name of the first author. In the case of compound names, use camel case, e.g. "deCampos".
* B: last name of the second author. If there are more than two authors, use the word "etal"
* C: one key word from the title of the paper, e.g. "DeepLearning", "LSTM".
* D: Acronym of the conference or journal where this was published, e.g. "CVPR", "arXiv".
* E: Publication year.
